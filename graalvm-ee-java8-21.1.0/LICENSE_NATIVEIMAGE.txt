License Rights
--------------
Oracle grants You a nonexclusive, nontransferable, limited license to
use the Early Adopter Versions and output created by the Early Adopter
Versions, subject to the license terms and restrictions that apply
to the Associated Program, and further subject to the terms of this
License for Early Adopter Versions.

All rights not expressly granted in this License for Early Adopter
Version are reserved by Oracle.

License Restrictions
--------------------
Output created by the Early Adopter Versions include proprietary
materials that prevent such output from being placed under an Excluded
License or other open source terms. You may not distribute the output
created by the Early Adopter Versions under an Excluded License or
other open source terms nor take any other action that would have the
effect of requiring such distribution. Without limiting the foregoing,
You may not distribute any application or code that combines the Early
Adopter Versions and output created by the Early Adopter Versions, or
any portion thereof, with any software that is subject to any version
of the GNU General Public License (GPL) or any license with a similar
reciprocal license obligation in a manner that would create a combined
or derivative work (including but not limited to distribution to any
third party contractor, affiliate, or subsidiary, or any employee
thereof that is not entitled to receive the Associated Program under
this Agreement).

The Early Adopter Versions may contain source code that, unless
expressly licensed herein for other purposes (for example, licensed
under an open source license), is provided solely for reference
purposes and may not be modified.

Early Adopter Versions
----------------------
Early Adopter Versions are subject to ongoing development, testing,
and modification. Oracle may significantly change the features and
functionality of Early Adopter Versions and future releases may
include changes that are incompatible with the current version. Oracle
may also place limits on backports. You may be required to change Your
application significantly to use future versions of the Early Adopter
Versions. Any development or other work You undertake with the Early
Adopter Versions is at Your sole risk.

Third-Party Technology
----------------------
The Early Adopter Versions may contain or require the use of third
party technology that is provided with the Early Adopter Versions.
Oracle may provide certain notices to You in EA Documentation, readmes
or notice files in connection with such third party technology.
Third party technology will be licensed to You either under the
terms of this Agreement or, if specified in the EA Documentation,
readmes or notice files, under Separate Terms. Your rights to use
Separately Licensed Third Party Technology under Separate Terms are
not restricted in any way by this Agreement. However, for clarity,
notwithstanding the existence of a notice, third party technology that
is not Separately Licensed Third Party Technology shall be deemed part
of the Early Adopter Versions and is licensed to You under the terms
of this Agreement.
